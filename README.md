## Learnings

Throughout the development of this React project, I gained valuable insights and skills that contributed to my growth as a developer. There were moments when I encountered challenges that required me to think deeply and problem-solve persistently, which ultimately enhanced my ability to tackle complex issues.

I deepened my understanding of React by working with components, props, and state. This project provided hands-on experience in building efficient and reusable UI components, enhancing the overall application structure. Moreover, I encountered instances where I got stuck, and it took me substantial contemplation and effort to overcome those obstacles. This process significantly contributed to honing my problem-solving skills and taught me the importance of perseverance in the face of challenges.
